# List of Operating Systems you might wanna try.
## This list contains my favourite OSes that you may wanna check out in a VM or flash it on your Pi. 
## Tutorials on how to flash the RPi are in this repo.

**Here is a quick table if you don´t care about the details**

| Place  | OS | Rating | Description | 
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |------------- |
| 1.  | Raspbian  | ★★★★★  | The official is always the first! If you are looking for a debian based OS, Raspbian is perfect for you. Not only is it damn lightweight but it can also run 90% of X86 aps with Wine and Box86. It is also a very good starter OS if you just bought a Raspberry Pi and are confused what to do with it.  |
| 2.  | Ubuntu  | ★★★★☆  | Without overclocking Ubuntu is very slow but it is still a known classic that you should try out. I would not advise to use this as your main desktop OS but if it is the only option or you just like Ubuntu I guess you can use it. I took down one star because of the need to overclock if you wanna use the Pi´s full potencional. |
| 3.  | Manjaro  | ★★★★☆  | Either Manjaro with KDE or XFCE desktop. It doesn´t matter. The core OS will still be the same. Manjaro personally did not require overclocking but I had to restart multiple tomes to get access to the desktop. Since it isn´t debian based, there is no such thing as APT. I took one star down cause I overall don´t see any usage into the OS other than a Room TV computer for some general purpose browing.  |
| 4.  | Chrome OS | ★★★★☆  | Chrome OS is a highschooler pain. Raspberry Pi is able to run it but there is no official way to flash it. So I decided to use Flyd OS. Flyd is a Chrome OS based OS and it runs smoothly. My only problems are that the windows sometimes start with like a glitching pixel inerface and it requires multiple reboots to actually launch an app without the glithching pixels. |
| 5.  | Kano OS  | ★★★★☆  | Kano OS is a very cute OS for kids and teenagers that specifies into games and easy coding. I would higly recommend giving this os to your kids and let them have the freedom.  |
| 6.  | RetroPie  | ★★★★☆  | Very cool if you are into nostalgic games. Could not pick up an offical Nintendo NES controller. Worked with a PS4 controller.    |
| 7.  | RecalBox  | ★★★☆☆  | Left me stuck on patch notes for an eternity.. Could not pick up any controllers and keyboard & mouse wasn´t responding. There was an extremely loud music coming from the speakers with no way to mute it. My friends have been able to deploy it and from their experience, I can say it isn´t a bad OS. |
| 8.  | Fedora  | ★★☆☆☆  | Could not get to run the OS at all. Was stuck on error -5 whilist writing to the SD card. Newer SD card did not help either. Fedora comnunity did not help at all. From images and videos of the OS. I can say it isn´t really bad but it may need some patching for older RPi models.  |
| 9.  | Java OS  | ★☆☆☆☆  | Added this in just as a joke. Freezes with multitasking and could not get the thing to even run on a Pi. |
| 10.  | Lindows / Linspire  |  ☆☆☆☆☆ | Classic still returns.. Lindows that got sued over their name for a 20 million dollar charge they renamed to Linspire. From start the apps have been crashing and not even launching and if you managed to launch an app you were stuck on one screen or the app was really laggy.  |

## If you are a developer of any of these OSes. Please don´t take this as a rant about what I don´t like about your favourite OS. This table is purely for helpful purposes and just because I had an issue with your OS doesn´t mean it wont work at all. That applies to the reader looking for what OS to install. It is totally your choice what OS are you gonna install. Plus you can always try a different OS.
