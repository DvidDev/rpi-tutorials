# List of Operating Systems you might wanna try.
## This list contains my favourite OSes that you may wanna check out in a VM or flash it on your Pi. 
## Tutorials on how to flash the RPi are in this repo.

**Here is a quick table if you don´t care about the details**

| Place  | OS | Rating | Description | 
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |------------- |
| 1.  | Raspbian  | ★★★★★  | The official is always the first! If you are looking for a debian based OS, Raspbian is perfect for you. Not only is it damn lightweight but it can also run 90% of X86 aps with Wine and Box86. It is also a very good starter OS if you just bought a Raspberry Pi and are confused what to do with it.  |
| 2.  | Ubuntu  | ★★★★☆  | Without overclocking Ubuntu is very slow but it is still a known classic that you should try out. I would not advise to use this as your main desktop OS but if it is the only option or you just like Ubuntu I guess you can use it. I took down one star because of the need to overclock if you wanna use the Pi´s full potencional. |
| 3.  | Manjaro  | ★★★★☆  | Either Manjaro with KDE or XFCE desktop. It doesn´t matter. The core OS will still be the same. Manjaro personally did not require overclocking but I had to restart multiple tomes to get access to the desktop. Since it isn´t debian based, there is no such thing as APT. I took one star down cause I overall don´t see any usage into the OS other than a Room TV computer for some general purpose browing.  |
| 4.  | RiscOS | ★★★★☆  | It was very complicated to read some text. Otherwise it is a very good OS if you have a CRT monitor and wanna make it look more aesthetic. |
| 5.  | DietPi  | ★★★★☆  | DietPi is a more server focused OS. I do not see a use for it in a home workstation unless you are planning to play sudoku in the terminal.  |
| 6.  | RetroPie  | ★★★☆☆  | Very cool if you are a nintendo fanboy. Could not pick up a controller from the nintendo NES. Had to reflash multiple times sadly. If you can get your controller picked up I guess you are lucky.   |
| 7.  | RecalBox  | ★★☆☆☆  | Left me stuck on the patch notes screen with very loud music comming from my monitor. Controller wasn´t even charging after connecting to the Pi. Maybe it is a good OS and I am just really dumb. But I had some bad experience with it so I do not think I will get back to it.  |
| 8.  | FullpageOS  | ★★☆☆☆  | Lacks features like actual browsing, sometimes it is not responing to clicks and a lot more. I think it is a good OS but I don´t feel like it should be used in actual kiosks for production.  |
| 9.  | PINN/NOOBS  | ★★★★☆  | You may ask why did I put a four star rated OS on the bottom. It is because PINN or NOOBS aren´t actual OSes. They just allow you to install multiple OSes on a single SD card. Kinda like a BIOS and dual booting. They contain almost all of the OSes that are in the RPi Imager. Would recommend if you are planning to dual-boot a Raspberry Pi. |
| 10.  | EEPROM (BOOTLOADER)  | CAN´T RATE  | The bootloder is an essential part of the Pi and I can´t put a rating to it since I can´t see the full interface for it. Even though this is not an OS I would like to give a huge thanks to the RPi community for containing the bootloader and constantly updating it to give patches.  |

### Now that I look at the table it doesn´t make much sense. Try and take your own out of it.

# I will work on a detailed guide for all of the OSes later. This took a long time to write and get the info for so I would love if you would give this repo a star or share it with your friends.
# If you are one of the Devs of these OSes don´t take my rant about it seriously. Just cause I encountered a bug doesn´t mean It can´t get resolved later.
